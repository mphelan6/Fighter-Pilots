  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Fighter Pilots is a multiplayer game, developed using the Unity Engine, for the PC platform. It is a relatively simple game, in which a player controls a WWI-style fighter and attempts to shoot down enemy fighters whilst gathering health and supplies. Implemented in Unity, the game’s logic is written in C# which makes calls to Unity’s API. Unity also has support for UnityScript (which is basically a modified version of JavaScript that can make calls to the Unity API). The multiplayer components make use of the Photon networking library, as Unity’s default networking capabilities are limiting. The assets for the game were modeled in Blender and textured using a Paint.NET. Although Photoshop and Maya are used more commonly in industry, Paint.NET and Blender are both free programs. GitHub was used for version control. This is a very typical development workflow for independent or small video game developers, although the skills used with these tools are easily adaptable to any scale of video game development. </p>
  <p>The scope of our project was limited in order to give our two man team reasonable goals. Multiplayer and AI were the main focuses for the project and were the most challenging from a programming perspective. If these goals were achieved, better assets and finishing touches would have been added to the game.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>All members of our team were passionate about video games and video game development. Charles had worked with Unity before making small scale games and had come into the project with a working demo of limited scope (no 3d models, no multiplayer and no menu screen). Charles experience with the game engine and the project left him doing a large amount of work on the artificial intelligence and networking. Mike had limited experience with the Unity engine along with a working knowledge of the basics of 3d modeling with Blender. He worked primarily on creating 3d assets and bringing them into the game engine with basic scripts (such as making the spare parts rotate). Mike had previous experience using GitHub with small projects, but neither team member had used GitHub extensively or with a project of this scale. The project ended up bring a learning experience for all team members.</p>

  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>The game is simplistic and requires no tutorials to learn or play. This makes the game easy to develop and play, without bloating it with unnecessary or incomplete features. The player controls their plane with the mouse. The plane gradually flies towards the mouse’s position on the screen, and the player can click to shoot. These controls are replicated across the network along with the rotation of the player’s planes. Replicating the exact position of each player along with every bullet on screen was exceedingly expensive (many bullets are on screen at once and replicating each transform was jittery and caused lag on the network) while replicating whether a player was shooting and allowing each client to handle the bullets themselves was a much more effective and elegant solution. When a player kills an enemy plane, a spare part is dropped which can be collected by the player. The spare part fills a “Parts” meter on the player’s screen which can be used to repair the player’s ship as long as the player is not shooting.</p>
  <p>The AI for the enemy has three stages: roaming, chasing and shooting. While roaming, the enemy flies randomly until a player flies into its line of sight. Once a player is in its line of sight, the enemy enters the chasing mode, where it fly at the player as long as the player remains less than a specific distance from the enemy; if the player becomes too far away, the enemy resumes roaming. If the player is being chased and is directly in front of the enemy, the enemy begins shooting. Although this behavior is not particularly complicated on paper, in-game it is more than enough to give the player a challenging enemy that is fun to play against.</p>
  <p>The game’s multiplayer involves two players flying with each other attempting to stay alive while killing as many randomly spawning enemies as possible. Players can fly nest to each other and shoot without fear of friendly fire (bullets from players only hurt enemies). Rooms are automatically created and joined using Photon Networking.</p>
  
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>Keeping our scope narrow and expanding as we made progress was entirely necessary and if we had not, the project would have been a complete disaster. Keeping this strategy in mind allowed us to effectively prioritize our tasks without getting bogged down by tasks that should have been saved for later (there’s no sense in modeling grass if the controls for the plane are not finished). The AI programming was also a resounding success: although the AI was uncomplicated, it worked and provided a good challenge. Creating the 3d assets took a while and importing them into Unity took some finagling. Multiplayer was a tough problem to tackle and was met with minimal success. After a good amount of work and fine tuning, the players were able to fly with each other smoothly and with minimal lag. They were also able to shoot and kill enemy planes, however upon killing a plane several glitches were encountered. Efforts to track down these glitches were ultimately unsuccessful. Testing involved both team members testing at the same time, alternating roles from host and client. This made testing slow and hard to coordinate (especially since many of the glitches would only crash the editor or only appear on one computer at a time). GitHub was also used with minimal success. Although GitHub was very useful for keeping track of our project, it was frequently a source of frustration. Given more experience with the tool, we are sure it would be invaluable, but there is a solid learning curve when collaborating using GitHub.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>This project was a great learning experience. Game development is a real challenge as it incorporates the use of several different programs and difficult programming. Working through a game from start to finish was at time tedious, but it gave an in-depth view of actual game development. Given more time, our game could have incorporated missions, better graphics and varied enemies, but given our time frame and busy schedules, Fighter Pilots is something we are proud of.</p>
